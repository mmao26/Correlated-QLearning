## Correlated-Q Learning -- Soccer Game Duplication

* Recently, multi-agent learning algorithm that learns equilibrium policies in general-sum Markov games has been developed, like Q-learning converges to optimal policies in Markov decision processes. [Friend-or-foe-Q algorithm](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-034.pdf) always converges, but it only learns equilibrium policies in restricted classes of game. Correlated-Q (CE-Q) learning, a multiagent Q-learning algorithm, is based on the correlated equilibrium solution concept.

* Four algorithms are, namely, Q learning, friend-Q, foe-Q and correlated-Q (CE-Q), implemented showed implementation details with corresponding pitfalls in Section 3. I compare our results of Q-value difference with results from [Greenwald & Hallâ€™s paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.589.8571&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and also discussed their optimal policies.
